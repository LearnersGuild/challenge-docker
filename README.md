# base [Docker][docker] image for challenges

This is not yet ready for public consumption. For one thing, it assumes that there is a `.floorc.json` file in the current folder (which there is not). Also, the `start.sh` file assumes a Floobits user that may or may not exist.

**Bottom-line:** Don't try to use this.

## Getting Started

```bash
$ docker build .
$ docker run -t <IMAGE ID>
```
